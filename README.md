# Homebrew Tap for Xbox Game Creator Tools

This repository is the Homebrew tap for Xbox Game Creator Tools.

## Installation

The tap can be added to Homebrew using the following command:

```sh
brew tap microsoft/xbox-game-creator-tools
```

Each individual tool can then be installed using the `brew install` command.
For example, to install the TAK CLI:
```
brew install tak-cli
```

### Shortcut

Alternatively, you can install the tools directly from the tap without adding it to Homebrew first. For example:
```
brew install microsoft/xbox-game-creator-tools/tak-cli
```
